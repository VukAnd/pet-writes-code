# Pet Writes Code
You say what to code, your pet will do the work. The times of spending hours trying to debug your code is over. Simply write what you want, and off it goes!
## Get Started
To start, simply download the [Official Pet Writes Code (PWC) API](https://github.com/hellogoose/pet-writes-code/tree/master/PWCApi). Follow the guidelines, write what you want, and watch your pet write the code, build, test and deploy!
### Examples
For a simple hello world program, written in Python:
`pwc --py display hello world`

and watch it do exactly what you wanted to.
`print('hello world!')`
#### Many different languages are supported
For example, here's a simple program in JavaScript: `pwc --javascript create variable(egg), egg is True, if egg is True then display 'egg is true'`

and it does everything for you.
```javascript
var egg = true;
if (egg = true){
    console.log("egg is true")
}
```
